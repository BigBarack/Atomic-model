# atomic model
## description
this is my project :joy:


## idea board
    simulate the electrons with fdtd?
    have the core be a solid point.
    maybe later have nuclear wave function slash forces? are there effects on the electron clouds(look up sources)

## road map one electron
1. I need to create a 3d model to visualise densities of electron clouds:
    1. wave clouds neeed to be a heatmap.(how to visualize different electrons, can work with colors)
    2. nucleus will just be a point mass (a mass would still be defined)
2. start with simulating one electron wave functions
    1. the waves need to be 0 at infinite and fluctuate locally.
    2. the core or multiple cores need to affect the electrons.
    3. start with schrodingers equation(maybe add relativistic effects later)
    4. make sure to have analytical solutions to compare results with 
    5. have multiple orbitals ready for the electron to excite to(how to check how much overlap is with electron and orbital)

3. add photon interaction with electron
    1. us a plane wave
    2. use a gaussian pulse(modeled after a laser)

4. can I see level splitting by electric and magnetic fields. (are they visible???)



## questions to answer
is angular momentum visible? can the simulation show electrons spinning or changing faster then normal.







## road map multiple electrons
1. electron correlation
2. spin effect
